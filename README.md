TargetedMinimumBids.ipynb walks through an example exploratory analysis, identifying the features of the data set that we can then use to build a simple but robust and effective bid strategy based on targeting customers that are unlikely to purchase policies and submitting a minimum bid (presumably $0.01) for them.

OptimizedVariableBids.ipynb builds a model around the assumption that increasing a bid price by $2.50 will shift an ad's display rank by one slot. Various bid strategies are then identified and offered as a strategy consideration to Acme.
